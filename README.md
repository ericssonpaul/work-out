# work-out

Work-Out is a Vue.js webapp for recommending different training exercises.
It is completely frontend-based, with no back end.
Note that although I hope it is useful, it's primarily a showcase Vue.js app for my portfolio.

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
